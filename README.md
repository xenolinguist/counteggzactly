Random Device Ideas

Free Ideas

Updating my repo with new code shortly...

###### Entities can create video footage of themselves working in real-time to log their productivity records to safeguard any intellectual property that may be generated through their creative efforts during this interval such as a breakthrough brand new idea. This would be done because the filming device would be a mixed "offline"/online hardware device connected between the two and included in the video footage that logs human productivity efforts there would be another part of the device that is a visual display showing fast changing random numbers on a dongle or something like RSA but much faster changing and powered by crypto. Then there is an AI component of the device powered by TPUs that evaluates the suitability of the work productivity log's broadcast to STARLINK for inclusion in the portfolio of work certified as owned by the US. Something like this to combat or at least better assess the nature of (international) intellectual property theft.

###### UPDATE: LET'S PUT DEFI UP IN THE WIFI!!! What about a secure protocol for WiFi that allows algorithmically hard testability of the internal data using something like a (generalized) "probabilistically difficult decryption" homomorphic encryption thus admitting a (weakly/partially) reviewable digital trace of the information as one of two options where the other is at least as traditionally secure. For the purposes of rewarding intelligent use of the internet with crypto that is mined by the protocol using a supervisory AI layer. For at least some applications an intelligent network management cryptographic wifi defi protocol.
Random Notes on the Completeness of the Geeks for Geeks Proof* but that have no general or immediate significance (one would think) but it could be cool for someone to verify how to complete this proof with respect to my below cat's cradle counterexample:

Cat's cradle counterexample to Hamiltonian Cycle argument on Geeks for Geeks because if one problem in NP-Hard is in some other class such as NP-Complete then they all are (unlikely to be relevant) but since such an important issue for cryptography apparently not professing to be an expert but I believe there are solution classes that are unlikely to be more efficient but that nevertheless are specifiable as refinements of any graph and these objects are specificable in polynomial-time then it could be worth looking into whether the additional path information they generate would be worthile to explore whether these or other additional P-time problem reformulations with additional information sets corresponding to the original problem objects should be addressed in these and similar proofs for sake of completeness). Trisecting argument internal information graph structure between all 3-set node triangles or 3-set edge triangles may either/or be generated in O(n^6). Don't you need to show (ALTHOUGH MY IDEA IS VERY UNLIKELY TO BE RELEVANT SINCE THERE HAVE BEEN MANY PROOF SEARCHES AND ALGORITHM SEARCHES ALREADY) that you can't walk such paths (of potentially more steps but also potentially more efficient steps) in NP-Hard worst case time?

ROUGH NOTES: I don't believe that the above proof definitively proves that TSP is NP-Hard or NP-Complete because you might have to consider more complex graphs with trisected paths or something anyways it's just not necessarily a sufficient proof in the absolute mathematical sense. But I think it's VERY VERY VERY VERY LIKELY and VERY VERY VERY VERY LIKELY ALREADY PROVEN BY SOME OTHER MORE COMPLETE PROOF CONSIDERING ALL POSSIBLE APPROACHES TO TSP. The reason it shows (potentially) that TSP is not provably NP-Complete (ONLY WITH RESPECT TO THE GEEKS FOR GEEKS PROOF ALTHOUGH MY INSIGHT IS VERY UNLIKELY TO RESULT IN MEANINGFUL DISCOVERY) is because there are other polynomial-time reformulations of the problem that could in theory lead to more efficient solutions so you would have to (in theory) disprove this as well... no? Otherwise you have not shown reducibility of the general form of the problem that would (although highly unlikely) result in a more efficient solution? This is a rather remote but debatable technical point.

It's still somewhat of a moot point since there are no known better than exponential time solutions but it shows that as I was always saying the Geeks for Geeks proof based on the the insight that the reducibility of the problem formulation to the Hamiltonian Cycle problem does not in and of itself in the absolute mathematical sense (ALTHOUGH NOT LIKELY TO BE RELEVANT) prove that TSP is NP-Hard so be careful when relying on these sorts of proofs to "prove" that a new problem is NP-Hard. At least for this specific proof and potentially some additional style of proof. Which is implicitly constructive and IMHO does not necessarily describe all possible P-time reducible problem formulations of TSP that (STILL VERY UNLIKELY) lead to more efficient solutions. So please check any new problem identified as NP-Hard, no don't just kidding, just didn't think the proof was sufficient but I know/suspect as a relative n00b you have other more general proofs to support these conclusions.
