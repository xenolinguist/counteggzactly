Select "classic" (intractable and/or erroneous) counterexamples from math books I purchased to review.

##### Random Device Proposals

###### Entities can create video footage of themselves working in real-time to log their productivity records to safeguard any intellectual property that may be generated through their creative efforts during this interval such as a breakthrough brand new idea. This would be done because the filming device would be a mixed "offline"/online hardware device connected between the two and included in the video footage that logs human productivity efforts there would be another part of the device that is a visual display showing fast changing random numbers on a dongle or something like RSA but much faster changing and powered by crypto. Then there is an AI component of the device powered by TPUs that evaluates the suitability of the work productivity log's broadcast to STARLINK for inclusion in the portfolio of work certified as owned by the US. Something like this to combat or at least better assess the nature of (international) intellectual property theft.

###### UPDATE: LET'S PUT DEFI UP IN THE WIFI!!! What about a secure protocol for WiFi that allows algorithmically hard testability of the internal data using something like a (generalized) "probabilistically difficult decryption" homomorphic encryption thus admitting a (weakly/partially) reviewable digital trace of the information as one of two options where the other is at least as traditionally secure. For the purposes of rewarding intelligent use of the internet with crypto that is mined by the protocol using a supervisory AI layer. For at least some applications an intelligent network management cryptographic wifi defi protocol.

If there are polynomial-time reformulations of NP problems that have the same exact solution but present it in a different way such that it is (VERY UNLIKELY TO BE BUT POTENTIALLY) more efficiently solvable then the "proof" that polynomial-time reducibility into NP-Hard of an NP problem proves NP-Completeness may be not itself be a complete proof (not sure would have to review the appropriate literature when I have time I'm just a n00b).

Cat's cradle (red) on (white) backdrop for a Travelling Salesman Problem complete problem graph (blue) producible in "n choose 3 composed of n choose 2" polymomial time, that might yield alternative solution approaches that could be ensured to always result in that same same exact solution to that particular/specific TSP problem instance but anyways since the main idea of NP-Hardness is no known better than worst case exponential solution it's largely a moot point, but it's (maybe but unlikely) a valuable technical point re: in terms of the comment in the paragraph before the link.
